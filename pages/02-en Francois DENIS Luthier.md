My studio is located in Angers, a charming town of the Loire Valley well known for its wines and old castles. 
Since 1988 I devoted myself to the violin making. My practice is deeply marked by my initial training in science and music 
as well by an historical research on the origin of violin making.

This work led in 2006 to the publication of the [« Traité de lutherie »](https://traitedelutherie.com).
